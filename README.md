## Features:

- Markdown text editor with live preview
- Account creation and login
- Articles filtered by topic, with each topic having its own page
- Articles sorting (newest-oldest, most liked, recommended)
- Search (articles, authors)
- Article interactions (Likes, Bookmarks, Comments)
- Each user that is logged has dedicated pages to view the articles that it wrote and the ones that it bookmarked
- User profile pages
- User settings page (users are able to change their name, email, password, etc.) (WORK IN PROGRESS)
- More to come...
